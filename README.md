# EvolutionSimulator
An evolution simulation using natural selection and neural networks

This evolution simulator creates creatures made up of joints and muscles. The contraction of each muscle is controlled by a neural network, and each node has a set friction. This allows the creatures to learn to walk. There are orbs in the air that the creatures must reach to increase their fitness. The most fit of the creatures reproduce, and their "genes" are mostly inherited, with some mutated. These genes control the muscles, joint layouts, brain structure and axon weights of the creatures.

It is currently very buggy. I am planning on remaking it, possibly in python using pygame.
